  Create a instance of a model epidemic based on the paper 
  "A model based evaluation of the 1996â€“7 pertussis epidemic in the Netherlands"
   by M van Boven 1, H E de Melker, J F Schellekens, M Kretzschmar in 2001. 

  Although the model is based in the paper considerations for the parameters are diferents, 
  in this instance some parameters has a free greather that  in the paper and the method of solution
  can have a diferent approach.
  

  The parameters for model are:
  1.  age_max:   Max age for analize.
  2.  sigma_v:   Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of loss of immunity after vaccination for each each age. 
  3.  sigma_i:   Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of loss of immunity after infection.
  4.  rho_1:     Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of loss of primary infection.
  5.  rho_2:     Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of loss of secondary infection.
  6.  v:         Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of vaccinated.
  7.  mu_s_1:    Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of mortality for susceptibles not vaccinated.
  8.  mu_s_2:    Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of mortality for susceptible individuals whose immune system has been primed before.
  9.  mu_i_1:    Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of mortality for infected  individuals with primary infection.
  10. mu_i_2:    Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of mortality for infected  individuals with secondary infection.
  11. mu_v:      Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of mortality for vaccinated individuals.
  12. mu_r:      Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of mortality for  protected indivduals after natural infection.
  13. lamb_f_1:  Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of force  in suscpetible group 1.
  14. lamb_f_2:  Iterable object of length (age_max + 1) with Rate of force  in suscpetible group 2.

  cond_bound: Is a list with conditions for S1(0,time_years) for time_years > 0  (The value in 0 is having into acount in the cond_init).
